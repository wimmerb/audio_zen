# audio_zen
This repository is part of my [master's thesis implementation](https://github.com/wimmerb/singing-quality-enhancement).
It provides utility and [Pytorch datasets](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html) to train Pytorch models on the following singing voice enhancement tasks:
* Denoising 
* Leakage/Spill Removal (Echo cancellation)

This repository implements modifications for the [audio_zen module](https://github.com/haoxiangsnr/FullSubNet/tree/main/audio_zen) in haoxiangsnr's FullSubNet.
