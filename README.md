This repository is part of my [master's thesis implementation](https://github.com/wimmerb/singing-quality-enhancement).
This repository provides utility and [Pytorch datasets](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html) to train Pytorch models on the following singing voice enhancement tasks:
* Denoising 
* Leakage/Spill Removal (Echo cancellation)
